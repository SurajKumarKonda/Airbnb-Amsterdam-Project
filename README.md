Airbnb Amsterdam Data Analysis and Visualization with NumPy and Pandas

This Github repo contains code for an Airbnb Amsterdam data analysis and visualization project using NumPy and Pandas. The goal of the project is to analyze the Airbnb dataset and create a user-friendly visualization using Streamlit.

This project involves utilizing Pandas for data cleaning, which includes eliminating duplicates, handling missing values, and rectifying inconsistencies. It also employs Pandas for data filtering and analysis through pivot tables and other functions. Integration of NumPy and Streamlit enables the creation of a feature for visualizing Airbnb listings on a map. Additionally, Streamlit is used to develop an interactive and user-friendly app, facilitating data exploration and analysis.
